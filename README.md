# Conspiracy

Conspiracy is a game developed for students of the course IJE of UnB-FGA college.

## History

The history of mankind goes through several mysteries, where some dare to say, that these events come from some extraterrestrial origin. Several theories arise at any moment, in the attempt to explain from the appearance of magnificent constructions until taken of the government.
In Brazil, a certain politician behaves strangely, with terrifying facial expressions and some conspiracy theorists claim that this politician is a strange being who has been infiltrating the country's political system for years. At some point of instability in the country, E. Temer, as he is called by some, decides to take for himself the political power of the country. E.Temer will count on the help of his companions from other galaxies, E.T. Bilu and E.T. De Varginha, on a mission at the farm ministry, where they will change documents that blame the current president for the execution of fiscal pedals. This audacious mission was organized with the intention of provoking the impeachment of the president, culminating in E. Temer as the new president of the country.
